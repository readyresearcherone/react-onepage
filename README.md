## Overview
It took me about 3 hours to finish the project, which was much shorter that I thought it would take. While I do have previous experience with JS/CSS/HTML, the only contact I had with frameworks such as React was then I created a basic RPG game in VUE.js. Nevertheless, even in that case I only use some basic functions like routing and conditional routing.
## What I learned 
Probably the most important thing is the fact that I now know how easy it is to create a website when you work with components instead of one full page.
#### React
- setting up a React project
- learned about how JSX works
- how importing and exporting works
- creating a React components
- useState React hook
- programmatically creating a page
- swiper JS
#### CSS
- reviewed responsive design
- reviewed media queries

## Next to learn
- routing - worked with it in VUE, should be easy to figure out
- learning more React hooks
- props & portals ("I'd love to help you solve the tests. But I cannot." -GlaDOS)
- Helmet - this seems like it would come in handy in certain situations
